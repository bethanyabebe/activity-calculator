## Purpose
Our project helps people connect with their community by recommending activities in their area. We decided to build this website to promote small business to people who are located nearby. We were inspired by articles describing how small business have been greatly negatively impacted during this pandemic

## Usage
The website consists of a short form with asks questions regarding budget, desired distance to be travelled, and overall preferences. Once the user submits the form, there is a call to the Google Maps API, which returns random activities in their area based on preferences. The user also has the ability to re-generate activities.

## Creation
This website was created as our final project during the FinTech Focus Program, a four-week immersive program designed for incoming college freshmen with an interest in finance, computer science and technology. ver the course of the program, participants were exposed to both computer science and financial technology, and were able to learn Python, Flask, and MongoDB, in addition to best practices when creating a product such as Minimal Viable Products (MVPs) and best ideation practices, such as wireframes.
